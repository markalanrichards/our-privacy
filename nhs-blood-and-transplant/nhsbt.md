# NHS BT (blood.co.uk) - Advertisers and analytics


## Context

NHS Blood and Transplant operates websites in the NHS portfolio.
If you want an idea of how bad some of the rest of tne NHS has been, have a look now (26/08/2018) as it still includes a lot of tracking and advertisers. NHS England and NHS Digital have removed some of the similar tracking.

The privacy policy and cookie policy do not explain the extent to which you are tracked and instead go as far as to lie and suggest you are not tracked.

NHS BT has user accounts, and therefore collects user data.
When they collect the data they don't protect access control from third party advertisers loading JavaScript.
For example, Facebook can not only track that you've signed up to blood.co.uk from cookies, they have access to read your email, date of birth, ethnicity, email, name and maybe more (I haven't explored all features).

## What does it mean?

 - _Cookies cannot be used to identify you personally_: A lie. One of the primary purposes of cookies is identification for authentication purposes.
 - _Analysing data, anonymously..," : misleading, as there is a identifiable tracking too
 - "We hold cookie information for 30 days before the cookie expires." : but they also state below they know that some cookies are stored for 24 months.
