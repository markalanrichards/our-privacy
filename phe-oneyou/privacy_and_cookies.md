# One You - Public Health England (20/07/2018)

The NHS website includes content from Public Health England.

Public Health England appear to often run health awareness campaigns, as opposed to getting directly involved in treating concerns.

Because they share a domain with the NHS, they may both leak cookies to each other and risk origin security risks.

Maybe not great, but, what about other third parties? The advertising companies, social media and analytics...

## Their most recent email to me stated:

> We would like to reiterate that the data our website operator obtains does not track users in a manner that identifies them personally. PHE complies with the laws governing the use of cookies, as set out by the Data Protection Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As stated in our previous correspondence; if users wish to restrict or block tracking information on our website, this option is available through the individualâ€™s browser settings.

> Should you remain dissatisfied with our data use policy, we would suggest you to pursue any outstanding issues through the regulatory body for information rights, The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

## But this isn't true

* On their site is still evidence of it loading Facebook, it loads third parties cookie before consent is even granted and the consent it demands does not match the statement they've made.
* Data protection law now requires users to opt-in and PHE isn't just demanding users opt-out, but that they change how their browser works, to protect themselves when using the site.

* Have a glance through and read about third parties, targeting and advertising.
* Very notably, read the details about Mobile Apps and what they state about third parties on those. This complaint so far has only focused on websites. Does anybody know someone who could look into the apps? - please get in touch

# Cookie Banner
Their Cookie Banner [image](pheoneyou.pdf)/[text](cookie_banner.md) misleads users and then their cookie policy demands users consent to a whole range of third parties and mentions tracking ids in various places.
