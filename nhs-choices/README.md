## Context

Since my complaint, last year, I haven't seen as many of these, although I definitely did see some and still can see some.

They may not always set cookies on the first request, you'll note in the video (below) only nhs and WebTrends appear to be setting cookies on first page load.

## What does it mean?

 - NHS knows it loads advertisers who target users
 - NHS doesn't maintain it's cookie policy properly (I am guessing the Russian sites are not GDPR friendly), but it is likely all of those domains are either active now or were active in the past: in either case how many years of browsing data did they get?
 - NHS expects users to agree and understand all of this - Cookie descriptions like "AppNexus uses the information to provide, operate, manage, maintain, and enhance the platform." do not explain that AppNexus is a programmatic advertising company.

## Some things to look for
